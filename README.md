# Sampler-WAM2
## Testing

To test the sampler, you can run it locally using a live server. Follow these steps:

1. Install a live server extension for your code editor (e.g., Live Server for VSCode).
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Start the live server from your code editor.

This will allow you to see the sampler running locally and make sure everything is working correctly.
